### Project Name

MindPath 

### Project Idea

Problem: Students struggle with mental health but often don't seek help due to stigma or lack of awareness of their emotional patterns.

Solution

Become the **primary digital mental health partner for Egyptian universities** by selling them an annual subscription for your platform. This platform should offer their students:

1. **Core Revenue Service:** **Online therapy sessions** with specialized, culturally-aware therapists (addressing the acute need).
2. **Key Engagement Tool:** A free, **anonymous peer-support community** and awareness events (reducing stigma and driving usage).
3. **Future Expansion:** A **premium mentorship** program for career anxiety (a unique differentiator).

**primary customer is the university, not the student.** This B2B model provides scalable revenue and makes the service free for students, solving the affordability problem and beating all direct-to-consumer competitors.

**sell a complete wellness solution to universities.**
